This is a useful link to help create [external link](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#links)

This is a link to the [README file](README.md)

The Progamming languages I've used are:
- Java
- C
- C++

My favorite language is **C** because:
1. C is the basis for Java and C++.
2. C compiles and runs faster.
3. C combines the features of both high-level and low-level languages.
